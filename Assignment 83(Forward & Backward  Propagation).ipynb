    "Problem: Neurons can become \"dead\" or inactive, where they no longer contribute to the learning process due to consistently negative \n",
    "         gradients.\n",
    "Solution: Using activation functions like Leaky ReLU or Parametric ReLU (PReLU) can help mitigate the dying neuron problem by introducing \n",
    "          a small positive gradient for negative inputs. These functions allow for a non-zero gradient and prevent neurons from becoming \n",

    "3. Overfitting:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Overfitting occurs when a neural network becomes too specialized to the training data and fails to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "Solution: Techniques to address overfitting include regularization methods such as L1 or L2 regularization (weight decay), dropout, early \n",
    "          stopping, or using techniques like cross-validation to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data. Increasing the amount of\n",
    "          training data or using data augmentation can also help prevent overfitting.\n",

    "4. Computational Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Deep neural networks with a large number of parameters can be computationally intensive during backward propagation, leading to \n",
    "         slow training times.\n",
    "Solution: Techniques like mini-batch gradient descent or stochastic gradient descent can improve computational efficiency by updating the \n",
    "          parameters using subsets of the training data instead of the entire dataset at once. Additionally, optimizing the implementation \n",
    "          of the backpropagation algorithm using parallel processing or specialized hardware (e.g., GPUs) can speed up the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Local Minima or Plateaus:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The optimization process during backward propagation can get trapped in local minima or plateaus, leading to suboptimal solutions.\n",
    "Solution: Techniques like using different optimization algorithms (e.g., stochastic gradient descent with momentum, Adam), learning rate \n",
    "          scheduling, or exploring random initialization can help escape local minima and find better solutions. Additionally, techniques \n",
    "          like adding noise to the gradients (e.g., noise injection) can help the optimization process navigate plateaus more effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Addressing these challenges in backward propagation requires a combination of careful parameter initialization, appropriate activation \n",
